# karate-js-test262

ECMAScript [test262](https://github.com/tc39/test262) conformance harness for
karate-js — the **living document** for evolving karate-js toward spec
compliance: a reproducible pass/fail matrix across the whole ES surface area,
plus the roadmap for which work to tackle in which order. **Not** published to
Maven Central — internal testing/reporting harness.

## Why this exists

karate-js is a lightweight JavaScript engine. Hand-written JUnit tests in
`karate-js/src/test/java/` cover behaviors we care about but tell us nothing
about **spec compliance**. Running tc39/test262 gives us ground truth — and
the module's committed skip list
([`etc/expectations.yaml`](etc/expectations.yaml)) becomes the declarative
statement of "what karate-js deliberately does not support."

The **real bar** is not spec-lawyer compliance — it is *can karate-js run
real-world JavaScript written in the wild, especially by LLMs?* test262 is the
scorecard; pragmatic ES6 coverage of idiomatic code is the goal.

---

## Working principles

Operating-mode maxims for engine-compliance work. Treat as load-bearing.

1. **Real-world JS first; test262 is the scorecard, spec is ground truth.** A
   fix that unblocks 500 idiomatic tests beats one that tightens a rare
   spec corner. `test/language/**` failures tell you the parser can't read
   common code; `test/built-ins/AggregateError` failures tell you a rarely-used
   constructor is missing — same FAIL count, very different signal. Existing
   JUnit tests can be wrong: when the spec disagrees, the spec wins — fix the
   test along with the engine.

2. **Fix friction before moving on.** Bad error messages in `results.jsonl`,
   parse-vs-runtime classification gaps, missing report fields, `--single -vv`
   not showing what you need — stop and fix the tooling rather than working
   around it. The `ContextListener` / `Event` / `BindEvent` surface is fair
   game for testability; not a load-bearing API guarantee.

3. **Errors must look like JavaScript, not Java.** Stronger form of #2: the
   engine's user-visible error surface is its own contract. Any raw Java
   exception escaping `Engine.eval(...)` is a correctness bug. See
   [JS_ENGINE.md § Exception Handling](../docs/JS_ENGINE.md#exception-handling).

4. **Protect the hot path — pay edge-case cost on the edge case.** New
   features dispatch via fast-path-then-fallback: sentinels over thrown
   signals, type-check rare cases after the common-case miss, parse-time
   analysis over inner-loop checks. After any non-trivial engine change, run
   `EngineBenchmark profile` and compare against
   [JS_ENGINE.md § Performance Benchmarks](../docs/JS_ENGINE.md#performance-benchmarks).

5. **Refactor toward elegance — fix inline or write it down, never carry the
   smell forward.** Spot near-duplicate dispatch or wrong-layer workarounds:
   either fix it now (cheapest moment is the session that just touched the
   area) or file a Deferred TODO with concrete pointers (file, method, what
   the unification looks like). Vague "this could be cleaner" notes are
   worthless. A workaround is a clue that the layer below is wrong.

6. **Batched commits are fine if the message enumerates the changes.** A
   single commit covering several related fixes from one session is preferred
   over the ceremony of splitting hunks across files. What matters is that
   the commit message lets a future bisect attribute regressions.

---

## Running

**All commands run from `karate-js-test262/`** (the runner resolves
`etc/expectations.yaml` and `test262/` relative to cwd). Use `-f ../pom.xml`
so Maven finds the parent reactor. After any change under `karate-js/`,
**re-install it first** — the runner uses the karate-js jar from your local
Maven repo, not from the reactor.

### Quick start

```sh
cd karate-js-test262
etc/fetch-test262.sh                                       # first time only — shallow clone
etc/run.sh --only 'test/language/expressions/addition/**'  # install + run + HTML
open target/test262/html/index.html
```

**Every run writes a fresh, self-contained directory:**
`target/test262/run-<timestamp>/` containing `results.jsonl`,
`results.jsonl.partial`, `run-meta.json`, `progress.log`, and `html/`. Old
runs are never touched (clean up with `mvn clean`). The runner prints
`Run dir: <path>` on completion; pass that to `Test262Report --run-dir
<path>` to render the HTML. `etc/run.sh` plumbs the path through
automatically.

[`etc/run.sh`](etc/run.sh) does install + run + HTML in a single command:

```sh
etc/run.sh                                                 # full suite + HTML
etc/run.sh --only 'test/language/**' --max-duration 300000 # 5-min cap
# Live tap (path is printed by the runner; substitute the actual <ts>):
tail -f target/test262/run-<ts>/progress.log               # live progress
tail -f target/test262/run-<ts>/results.jsonl.partial      # live per-test JSONL
```

### Driving the pieces by hand

```sh
# 1. After editing karate-js/, refresh the local Maven repo
mvn -f ../pom.xml -pl karate-js -o install -DskipTests

# 2. Run the suite (sequential; minutes to tens of minutes)
#    Run-dir defaults to target/test262/run-<timestamp>/; the runner prints it.
mvn -f ../pom.xml -pl karate-js-test262 -o exec:java \
    -Dexec.args="--only test/language/expressions/**"

# 3. HTML report — required: --run-dir pointing at step 2's output
mvn -f ../pom.xml -pl karate-js-test262 -o exec:java \
    -Dexec.mainClass=io.karatelabs.js.test262.Test262Report \
    -Dexec.args="--run-dir target/test262/run-<ts>"
```

**Why install instead of `-am`:** `exec:java` is a direct goal, not a phase,
so Maven invokes it on every selected reactor project. With `-am`, the reactor
also includes `karate-parent` (no `mainClass`), and the goal aborts the run
before our module is reached. Installing karate-js to the local repo first,
then running without `-am`, sidesteps the reactor entirely.

### Flags

| Flag | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `--expectations <path>` | `etc/expectations.yaml` | skip list manifest |
| `--test262 <path>` | `test262` | suite clone dir |
| `--run-dir <path>` | `target/test262/run-<timestamp>/` | output dir for this run; everything (results.jsonl, run-meta.json, progress.log, html/) goes inside |
| `--timeout-ms <n>` | `10000` | per-test watchdog (infinite-loop guard) |
| `--max-duration <ms>` | `0` (unlimited) | overall wall-clock cap; writes partial results and prints `Aborted:` on hit |
| `--only <glob>` | — | restrict to matching paths |
| `--single <path>` | — | run one test, no file writes |
| `-v` / `-vv` | off | (with `--single`) `-v` prints parsed metadata + source location; `-vv` adds full source |

Runs are **silent except failures + periodic progress**. A `FAIL <path> —
<type>: <msg>` line prints to stdout per failure; a `[progress]` line every
500 tests or every 5 seconds. Banner / progress / summary lines are mirrored
to `<run-dir>/progress.log` via Logback so `tail -f` is a lightweight live
view. Per-FAIL detail lives only in JSONL (mirroring would duplicate without
new signal).

### Hang handling

The runner uses a single-thread `ExecutorService` to enforce `--timeout-ms`
per test. The karate-js engine doesn't poll `Thread.interrupt()`, so
`cancel(true)` can't stop the underlying thread. When a timeout fires, the
runner **retires the executor** (shuts it down, creates a fresh one) so
subsequent tests don't queue behind the stuck thread. Net cost of a genuine
hang: one abandoned daemon thread, one Timeout row in `results.jsonl`, a few
ms of recreate overhead.

### Driving from scripts / agents

Pass `--max-duration <ms>` so a catastrophic engine bug can't wedge the
caller. The periodic `[progress]` line gives a machine-parseable heartbeat —
stream stdout and tail the most recent line without waiting for the run.

## Active priorities

Action list — start at the top. Ordered by core-engine confidence
cross-multiplied by score impact. Re-probe with the relevant `--only` glob
before scoping a session.

**Current state baseline** (last sampled 2026-04-26, post JsArray hole
sentinel + length truncation + length descriptor):

| Slice | Pass | Fail | Skip | Total |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `test/language/**` | 4311 | 3792 | 15542 | 23645 |
| `test/built-ins/Math/**` | 293 | 33 | 1 | 327 |
| `test/built-ins/Number/**` | 232 | 96 | 12 | 340 |
| `test/built-ins/String/**` | 456 | 717 | 50 | 1223 |
| `test/built-ins/Array/**` | 1256 | 1645 | 180 | 3081 |
| `test/built-ins/Object/**` | 2035 | 1251 | 125 | 3411 |
| `test/built-ins/Date/**` | 500 | 52 | 42 | 594 |
| `test/built-ins/Function/**` | 229 | 152 | 128 | 509 |
| `test/built-ins/Symbol/**` | 2 | 47 | 49 | 98 |

### Top items

1. **Full Symbol primitive (layer 2 — promoted from former #1's "deferred"
   tail).** Partial expansion shipped 2026-04-26: well-known symbols are
   exposed as string-keyed stand-ins, `@@toPrimitive` dispatches via
   `Terms.toPrimitive` (and now `Terms.add` — binary + / +=), `@@toStringTag`
   overrides `Object.prototype.toString`, `Date.prototype[@@toPrimitive]`
   landed (default→string per spec). Net delta vs prior baseline: **+25
   language, +23 Date, +2 Symbol, +1 Object/Function each ≈ +52 PASS**, with
   ~109 fewer SKIPs. Residual is the *Symbol-as-primitive* tests:
   `typeof Symbol.X === "symbol"`, `Symbol()` constructor with unique
   identity, `Symbol.for` / `keyFor` global registry, `symbol.description`,
   `Object.getOwnPropertySymbols`, `Reflect.ownKeys` returning symbol keys.
   Touches: new primitive type in `Terms.typeOf` / `eq` / coercion sites;
   property-key abstraction so `JsObject._map` (currently `Map<String,Object>`)
   can carry symbol keys distinct from string keys; `_attrs` / `_tombstones`
   / `isOwnProperty` / intrinsic-attribute pipeline all key by `String` and
   need parallel symbol storage. ~580 SKIPs today; 2-4 sessions of focused
   work. Re-probe before scoping with `test/built-ins/Symbol/**` to size
   per-feature cluster.

2. **`this = 1` / `import.meta = 1` / `eval = 1` NPE.** Tier-1 negative-test
   stragglers. `this` lexes as IDENT; `import.meta` parses as a normal
   `REF_DOT_EXPR`; `eval = 1` hits a pre-existing NPE in the engine's
   host-bindings setup (`Cannot read field "listener" because "this.root"
   is null`). 5 fails total in `expressions/assignmenttargettype/**`.

3. **JsArray per-index attribute tracking (residual).** Layer-2 landed
   2026-04-26: `JsArray.HOLE` sentinel distinguishes sparse holes from
   `null`/`undefined`; `arr.length = N` truncates / extends with HOLE per
   §10.4.2.4 ArraySetLength; `Object.defineProperty(arr, "length", {value:
   N})` routes through the same `setLength` path; `arr[i] = x` for `i >=
   size` extends with HOLE-padding; `length` reports its spec descriptor
   `{writable: true, enumerable: false, configurable: false}`; `hasOwn` /
   `Object.keys` / `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor` honor own-vs-hole
   semantics; `JsArray.jsEntries` and `IterUtils.listIterator` translate
   HOLE for hole-skipping (forEach/map/filter) vs hole-as-undefined
   (for-of/spread) per spec. Net delta vs prior baseline: **+14 Array,
   +21 Object, +21 language ≈ +57 PASS**, no JUnit regressions.
   Residual is per-index attributes: `defineProperty(arr, "0",
   {writable: false, value: x})` writes to the dense list and loses the
   `writable: false` bit (no parallel `_attrs` map on JsArray). Adding
   one mirrors what `JsObject._attrs` already does and would unblock the
   `Array/prototype/*-target-array-with-non-writable-property` cluster.

### Background

Picked off opportunistically when nearby — not session-sized on their own.

- **Map / Set residuals.** `Map.prototype.{groupBy, getOrInsert,
  getOrInsertComputed}` (ES2024+). `Set.prototype.{difference, intersection,
  union, isDisjointFrom, isSubsetOf, isSupersetOf, symmetricDifference}`
  (ES2025; some test cases use `with` blocks). `Object.getPrototypeOf(Map.
  prototype)` returns `JsObjectPrototype.INSTANCE` (singleton) where tests
  compare against `Object.prototype` (the global) — needs identity sharing.
  Same for `Set.prototype`.

- **`.length` / `.name` rollout to remaining prototypes.** `JsBuiltinMethod`
  infra is in place; Date is wired. Probe (2026-04) shows the *incremental*
  test count from sweeping it through other prototypes is small — most
  `length.js` fails are about array-instance length semantics, most `name.js`
  fails are Symbol-gated. Treat as background cleanup.

- **Utility-method residual sweep.** String.prototype is nearly complete
  (`padStart` / `padEnd` / `replaceAll` / `matchAll` / `at` all landed). Pick
  off remaining gaps as triage surfaces them.

- **Destructuring residuals.** Bulk works; the long tail is low-leverage —
  lexer identifier-escape support, TDZ / init-order corners, negative parse
  tests needing pattern-vs-literal two-mode parsing.

- **Cleanup residuals.** Occasional `"null"` NPE paths, `IllegalName` JDK
  lambda leak, `Java heap space` OOM in array-slice paths. Grab while nearby.

- **Directive prologue (`"use strict"`) flip.** Parser tolerates the string
  without activating strict-mode assertions. Skip triage is done (`flags:
  [onlyStrict]` entry in `expectations.yaml`). Real strict-mode implementation
  (with / duplicate-params / eval-assign / octal-literal negative checks) is
  a separate, larger project; revisit only if a meaningful test cluster
  outside `onlyStrict` depends on it.

---

## Deferred TODOs

Items left for later; un-scheduled but tracked.

- **Promises + async/await + setTimeout.** All skipped today (`feature:
  Promise`, `feature: async-functions`, `flag: async`, `feature:
  Symbol.asyncIterator`, `include: promiseHelper.js`). karate-js is
  synchronous — no event loop, no microtask queue, no timers. When eventually
  scheduled: smooth Java interop with `CompletableFuture` / callback APIs;
  graceful degradation when async/await is decorative; simple multi-threading
  for real async I/O (websockets, Kafka, gRPC). Microtask model / thread
  strategy / `setTimeout` backing belong in the implementation session.

- **Class syntax (ES6).** All skipped (`feature: class`, `class-fields-public`,
  `class-fields-private`, `class-methods-private`, `class-static-fields-public`,
  `class-static-methods-private`). Engine has prototype machinery + `new`
  but no parser support for `class` / `extends` / `super` /
  method-definition. LLMs writing glue/test code default to function +
  prototype style; pick up only if real workload demands. Currently fails
  loudly at parse time with `SyntaxError` — the right shape.

- **Unify the read-side dot dispatch in `PropertyAccess`.** Write-side is
  unified through `resolveWriteSite` + `AccessSite` (10 near-duplicate
  dispatch wrappers collapsed). Read-side (`getRefDotExpr`,
  `getCallableRefDotExpr`) still has mirrored bridge-fallback + `?.` logic
  with slightly different return shapes. Defer until there's a third caller
  that wants the same resolution shape.

- **Replace hand-rolled YAML parser with SnakeYAML.** `Expectations.java` and
  `Test262Metadata.java` are hand-rolled to avoid the dep. They break on `#`
  in quoted reasons, block-scalar (`|`, `>`) `description:` fields, and
  block-form list values. Add SnakeYAML when we next touch either file.

- **Make `--resume` refresh stale records.** Currently echoes back records
  for tests that no longer exist or are now SKIP'd. Either gate on
  test-still-exists + not-in-skip-list, or rename to `--resume-crash-only`.

- **Cache parsed harness ASTs, not source text.** `HarnessLoader` re-parses
  `assert.js`, `sta.js`, and each test's `includes:` on every test;
  ~50k re-parses per full-suite run is a measurable chunk of wall time.

- **`phase: resolution` (module-resolution) negative tests.** Currently
  conflated with `runtime`. Modules are globally skipped via `flags:
  [module]`, so this is latent.

- **Structured `$262` surface.** `AbstractModuleSource`, `IsHTMLDDA`,
  `agent.broadcast/getReport/sleep/monotonicNow` are absent — all
  feature-gated, unreachable today. Add stubs when a feature comes off the
  skip list.

- **`readHeadSha` path fragility.** `Test262Runner.readHeadSha` walks up
  `cli.test262.getParent().getParent()` to find the karate repo. Prefer a
  `git rev-parse HEAD` subprocess, or a `--karate-sha` flag.

- **Surface per-test console capture in `ResultRecord`.** `evaluate(...)`
  already wires `Engine.setOnConsoleLog(...)` to a per-test sink (discarded
  today). Plumb it into `ResultRecord` for FAIL rows so `--single -vv` and
  the HTML drill-down can show what the test printed.

- **Parallel execution.** Prior attempts showed no speedup on moderate slices
  (thread context-switch overhead beat the 1ms per-test eval cost) and the
  engine doesn't poll `Thread.interrupt()`. Revisit when per-test cost grows
  enough that 8× parallelism clearly wins, or when the engine learns to
  cooperatively abort.

- **Commit `target/test262/results.jsonl` once stable.** Currently gitignored
  (too noisy in git while engine iterates). Re-evaluate when the engine is
  stable enough that diffs are meaningful.

- **Thin `EngineException` once `JsError` goes public.** `EngineException`
  carries a `jsErrorName` string that duplicates what's in the cause-chain's
  `JsErrorException` payload. `JsError` is package-private, so we can't just
  expose the payload. Once a host use case forces `JsError` public, drop the
  name field.

## Engine guarantees (test262-driven)

Engine rules established by prior compliance work. Treat as load-bearing — if
a session needs to violate one, the rule goes up for review explicitly. **Full
prose lives in [JS_ENGINE.md § Spec Invariants](../docs/JS_ENGINE.md#spec-invariants-test262-driven).**

**Errors & exception routing**
- Engine-emitted errors route through registered constructors (`<Name>:`
  prefix → `JsError` with linked `.constructor`)
- `Test262Error` / user-defined errors classified via `constructor.name` fallback
- `ErrorUtils.classify` scans embedded `<Name>:` as a fallback
- JVM exception → JS error mapping at the `evalStatement` catch
  (`IndexOutOfBoundsException`/`ArithmeticException` → RangeError; NPE/CCE/NFE → TypeError)
- `JsError.constructor` populated at JS try/catch wrapping
- Error position framing leads with the message (`at <path>:<line>:<col>`)
- `EngineException` exposes a structured `getJsMessage()` (the unframed
  JS-side `.message` value, no `<Name>:` prefix, no host `js failed:` frame)
  alongside `getMessage()` (framed for logging) and `getJsErrorName()`. Host
  callers building a JS-facing surface should prefer `getJsMessage()` —
  no message-string parsing needed.

**typeof & callable identity**
- `typeof` reports `"function"` on every callable surface (JsInvokable,
  JsFunction, built-in constructor singletons, JsCallable method refs)

**Globals**
- `eval` is a global with indirect-eval semantics (no scope capture)

**Iteration**
- Iteration goes through `IterUtils.getIterator`; `for-of` on null/undefined
  is TypeError, `for-in` keeps `Terms.toIterable`
- Partial `Symbol` global — well-known symbols exposed as string-keyed
  stand-ins (`@@iterator`, `@@asyncIterator`, `@@toPrimitive`, `@@toStringTag`,
  `@@hasInstance`, `@@isConcatSpreadable`, `@@species`, `@@match`, `@@matchAll`,
  `@@replace`, `@@search`, `@@split`, `@@unscopables`); no constructor / no
  unique identity / no `typeof === "symbol"`

**Optional chaining**
- `PropertyAccess.SHORT_CIRCUITED` sentinel propagation (distinct from
  `Terms.UNDEFINED`); converted to UNDEFINED only at chain root

**Object literals & destructuring**
- Reserved words as object-literal keys (`{break: x}`, `{class: foo}`, …)
- Destructuring uses `ObjectLike.getMember`; defaults fire on `undefined`
  only; array-source routes through `IterUtils.getIterator`

**Numeric / coercion**
- Spec ToString unified via `Terms.toStringCoerce`
- `Terms.toPrimitive` is the spec ToPrimitive boundary — checks `obj["@@toPrimitive"]`
  first (set-but-not-callable is TypeError; result must be primitive), then
  falls back to `Terms.ordinaryToPrimitive` (valueOf/toString dispatch with
  sub-context error propagation)
- `Terms.add` (binary `+` / `+=`) ToPrimitive's ObjectLike operands first per
  spec — gained a `CoreContext` parameter for that
- `Terms.narrow()` checks both ends (overflow fix on negative-past-MIN_VALUE)

**BigInt**
- BigInt rides on `java.math.BigInteger` with type-tested dispatch; mixing
  with Number is TypeError via `requireBothBigInt`
- Numeric separators sit on the rare-path lexer rule (zero allocation on
  the common path)

**Property attributes**
- Per-property attributes use a sparse byte map (`_attrs`); absent = all-true
- `defineProperty` enforces "missing-fields default false on new keys,
  preserve on existing"; configurability rules enforced
- `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty` is prototype-aware and intrinsic-aware
- Intrinsic-attribute pipeline (`hasOwnIntrinsic` + `getOwnAttrs`) feeds the
  descriptor read pipeline
- Tombstone-on-delete for intrinsic properties (`_tombstones` set)
- `JsObject.isOwnProperty(name)` is the canonical own-key check

**Prototype machinery**
- Built-in prototypes accept user-added properties (`userProps` on `Prototype`)
- Per-Engine prototype isolation — `clearAllUserProps` + `clearAllEngineState`
  walk registered singletons on each `new Engine()`
- Function declarations hoist (and the main eval loop *skips* hoisted
  FN_EXPR statements)
- `Array.prototype.*` are generic over array-like `this` via `rawList`'s
  `.length` + indexed snapshot
- `JsArray.getMember` resolves canonical numeric-index keys (rejects `"01"`,
  `"+1"`, `"1.0"`)
- `JsArray` indexed-accessor enforcement: descriptors installed via
  `Object.defineProperty(arr, i, {get/set/value: ...})` land in `namedProps`
  under the canonical string-form key and take precedence over the dense
  list backing store. Reads dispatch via `JsArray.getIndexedSlot(i)` (hot
  path: single null-check on `namedProps`); writes route through the
  named-key path when `hasIndexedDescriptor(i)` so accessor setters fire.
  `rawList` / `jsEntries` take the per-index snapshot path when
  `arr.hasAnyDescriptor()` so `Array.prototype.*` callbacks see resolved
  values, not the JsAccessor wrapper.
- `JsArray.HOLE` sentinel marks sparse slots distinct from `null` /
  `undefined`. `[0,,2]` writes HOLE at index 1 (not null), so
  `arr.hasOwnProperty(1) === false` while `[0,null,2].hasOwnProperty(1)
  === true`. Read seams translate HOLE to `undefined` (`getElement`,
  `List.get`, `PropertyAccess.getByIndex` for raw List, `IterUtils`
  iterator) so user code never observes the sentinel; iteration helpers
  that the spec says skip holes (`Array.prototype.{forEach, map, filter,
  every, some, find, findIndex, reduce, reduceRight}`) do so via
  `JsArray.jsEntries` which skips HOLE entries.
- `arr.length = N` truncates the dense list when N < current size or
  pads with HOLE when N > current size, per §10.4.2.4 ArraySetLength.
  `arr[i] = x` for `i >= size` extends with HOLE-padding to grow the
  array in one shot. `Object.defineProperty(arr, "length", {value: N})`
  routes through the same `setLength` path. `length` exposes its spec
  descriptor `{writable: true, enumerable: false, configurable: false}`
  via `JsArray.getOwnAttrs`.
- `JsArray.isOwnProperty` is the canonical own-key check for arrays —
  covers `length`, `namedProps` entries (descriptors / named props), and
  canonical numeric indices in range that are not HOLE. Wired through
  `Object.hasOwn`, `arr.hasOwnProperty`, `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor`,
  and the `ownKeys` helper that backs `Object.keys` /
  `Object.getOwnPropertyNames`.
- `Function.prototype.bind` returns a new JsFunction with bound `thisObject`
  + pre-bound args

**Date**
- `JsDate` stores `[[DateValue]]` as `double` with NaN = Invalid Date;
  helpers (`makeDay` / `makeTime` / `timeClip` / `localToUtc` / `utcToLocal`)
  shared between Constructor and Prototype
- LocalTZA truncated to integer minutes (per spec `getTimezoneOffset`)
- Setters read `[[DateValue]]` *before* coercing args (preserves observable
  side effects from valueOf)
- `Date.prototype[@@toPrimitive]` overrides "default" hint to "string" per
  §21.4.4.45 — `date + ""` and `date + date` string-concat instead of
  timestamp-add. Calls `Terms.ordinaryToPrimitive` to avoid re-entering the
  @@toPrimitive lookup.

**Templates**
- Tagged-template AST shape — `FN_TAGGED_TEMPLATE_EXPR` is `[<callable>,
  LIT_TEMPLATE]`; N substitutions ⇒ N+1 string slots; `strings.raw` attached

**Object.prototype.toString**
- Consults `obj.getMember("@@toStringTag")` first; if a string, uses it as
  the tag. Otherwise dispatches on host wrapper class (`[object Date]` /
  `Array` / `Map` / `RegExp` / `Set` / `Error` / `Boolean` / `Number` /
  `String` / `Function` / `Object`)
- `Error.prototype.toString` shadows `Object.prototype.toString` in
  `JsError.getMember` (returns `name + ": " + message` per spec) — exposed
  as a latent bug when `Terms.add` started routing ObjectLike operands
  through `Terms.toPrimitive`

**Engine ↔ runner contract**
- Runner depends on `ParserException` propagation (parse-phase classification),
  `EngineException` wrapping (runtime), and JS-error-name prefix injection at
  `Interpreter.evalProgram` — see `ErrorUtils` and the Engine guarantees above.

Guidance:
- **Pure tokenization change** → `JsLexer` + `JsLexerTest`.
- **Grammar change** → `JsParser` + `JsParserTest` (AST shape) + `EvalTest`
  (runtime semantics).
- **Semantics-only change** → `Interpreter.java` or the relevant
  `Js*Prototype`; test in `EvalTest` or the matching `Js*Test`.
- `NodeType` and `TokenType` are small enums — consult them before inventing
  new node/token kinds; many "feels like I need a new node" fixes turn out
  to be wiring an existing one to a new call site.
- **`EngineTest` is *not* a test262 sink.** It covers the engine's
  integration surface: `ContextListener` events, `BindEvent`, `Engine.put`
  lifecycle, Java↔JS exception boundary, `$BUILTIN`/prototype immutability.
- **When to split a `Js*Test`:** don't pre-emptively. If a cluster inside
  `EvalTest` grows to ~10+ tests on one feature (destructuring, TDZ,
  template literals), spin it out — let the split follow the evidence.

## Skip list

There is only one concept: **SKIP**. A test matching any rule in
[`etc/expectations.yaml`](etc/expectations.yaml) is not run and appears as
`{"status":"SKIP",...}` in results. Everything else is attempted; failures
are failures.

Match order: `paths → flags → features → includes`. **First match wins.**
Every entry requires a `reason`.

**Precedence example.** A test at `test/language/statements/class/foo.js`
with `flags: [module]` and `features: [Symbol]` is skipped with the *module*
reason (the `flags` match fires before `features` is consulted). If you want
`features: [Symbol]` to win, don't have a matching flag rule.

Starter set covers Symbol, BigInt, generators, class syntax, Proxy, Reflect,
Promises, async/await, Temporal, TypedArray beyond Uint8Array, WeakRef,
ArrayBuffer, and the suite directories `test/intl402/`, `test/staging/`,
`test/annexB/`. To add a skip: edit the YAML under the right section with a
`reason`. To remove a skip: delete the entry, re-run the relevant `--only`
glob, debug failures with `--single -vv`.

---

## Results schema

Two JSONL files during a run:

- **`target/test262/results.jsonl.partial`** — appended per test as results
  arrive, flushed per write. **Run order, not sorted.** Deleted on clean
  exit; preserved on abort (`--max-duration` hit, Ctrl-C, JVM kill).
- **`target/test262/results.jsonl`** — canonical output, **sorted
  alphabetically by path**, atomically written at end-of-run (tmp + rename).
  This is what tooling reads and what `--resume` skips-seen against.

Example line shape (same in both):

```jsonl
{"path":"test/language/expressions/addition/S11.6.1_A1.js","status":"PASS"}
{"path":"test/.../something.js","status":"FAIL","error_type":"TypeError","message":"foo is not a function"}
{"path":"test/.../bigint-test.js","status":"SKIP","reason":"BigInt not supported"}
```

Error types are classified into:
`SyntaxError | TypeError | ReferenceError | RangeError | Error | Timeout |
Harness | Unknown` by inspecting message prefixes (the engine emits
`"TypeError: ..."` style messages at most failure sites). The classifier
itself is in `ErrorUtils`.

## Recipes

### Debug one failing test

```sh
mvn -pl karate-js-test262 -o exec:java \
    -Dexec.args="--single <path> -vv"
```

`-v` prints parsed YAML metadata (description / flags / features / includes
/ negative), the classification, and — if the engine attached a position
— a `location: <path>:<line>:<col>` line. `-vv` additionally prints the
full test source. `--single` does no file writes; pass any test path
(relative to the test262 clone root) directly. **No HTML drill-down page is
generated** — the details.html report shows path + error_type + message
inline; for full source / repro context, run `--single -vv` directly.

### Check performance after an engine change

The conformance suite allocates a fresh `Engine` per test (~50k tests); small
regressions compound into minutes of wall time. **Prefer profile mode** — the
30 s warm loop is JIT-stable and directly comparable to the reference table.

```sh
mvn -pl karate-js -q test-compile

# Profile mode (30 s warm loop; JIT-stable, ~16k iterations averaged).
# This is the mode the reference table in JS_ENGINE.md was recorded in.
java -cp "karate-js/target/classes:karate-js/target/test-classes:$(find ~/.m2/repository -name 'slf4j-api-*.jar' | head -1):$(find ~/.m2/repository -name 'json-smart-*.jar' | head -1):$(find ~/.m2/repository -name 'accessors-smart-*.jar' | head -1):$(find ~/.m2/repository -name 'asm-9*.jar' | grep -v asm-tree | grep -v asm-commons | head -1)" \
    io.karatelabs.parser.EngineBenchmark profile

# Fast mode (median of 10 cold runs) — noisy, gut-check only
java -cp "…same classpath…" io.karatelabs.parser.EngineBenchmark
```

Compare against [JS_ENGINE.md § Performance Benchmarks](../docs/JS_ENGINE.md#performance-benchmarks).
If averages moved >±10%, understand why before merging. If unavoidable
(correctness > speed), update the reference table in `JS_ENGINE.md` in the
same commit.

### Bump the pinned test262 SHA

Edit `TEST262_SHA=...` at the top of `etc/fetch-test262.sh`, delete the local
`test262/` directory, re-run the script. All subsequent runs use the new
commit. Coordinate bumps with whoever else is iterating — the suite itself
evolves.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause / fix |
|---|---|
| `expectations file not found: etc/expectations.yaml` | Wrong directory. `cd karate-js-test262` first. |
| `test262 directory not found: test262` | Haven't run `etc/fetch-test262.sh` yet. |
| `Failed to execute goal ... exec-maven-plugin ... on project karate-parent: 'mainClass' ... missing` | Used `-am` with `exec:java`. Don't — install `karate-js` separately and run without `-am`. |
| Engine change has no effect on test262 output | Forgot `mvn ... -pl karate-js -o install -DskipTests`. The runner uses the local Maven repo jar, not the reactor classpath. |
| `Test262Report` says `--run-dir <path> is required` | Pass the path the runner printed on completion: `--run-dir target/test262/run-<ts>`. `etc/run.sh` does this for you. |
| Where's my report? | The runner prints `Run dir: <path>` on completion. Look in `<path>/html/index.html`. Each invocation creates a fresh `run-<timestamp>/` dir; nothing is overwritten. |
| `ReferenceError: <name> is not defined` on common classes (`ReferenceError`/`RangeError`) | Known first-order gap — those constructors are not registered globals yet. |
| Suite hangs on one test | Infinite loop; watchdog kicks in at `--timeout-ms`. The inner executor is retired and replaced; a genuine hang leaks one daemon thread and keeps going. Bisect with `--only`, or add `--max-duration` as a safety net. |
| Driving from a script that must not block | Pass `--max-duration <ms>`. On hit, partial results written and `Aborted:` replaces `Summary:`. |
| Tests that used to pass now fail | Run `EngineBenchmark` too — perf regression sometimes manifests as timeouts before correctness. |
| `target/test262/` growing unbounded across iteration sessions | No auto-pruning; each run writes its own `run-<ts>/`. `mvn clean` wipes the lot. |

Each run is self-contained and immutable; old runs persist until `mvn clean`.
The CI workflow uploads `target/test262/` (parent) as a single artifact.

---

## CI

A `workflow_dispatch`-only workflow at
[`.github/workflows/test262.yml`](../.github/workflows/test262.yml) runs
`etc/fetch-test262.sh` + the runner + the report, and uploads the whole
`target/test262/` directory as a single artifact. Never triggered
automatically — kick off from the Actions tab when you want a fresh run. Two
inputs (`only` and `timeout_ms`) default to full-suite / 10 s per test.

The module's `pom.xml` sets `maven.deploy.skip=true` / `gpg.skip=true` /
`skipPublishing=true` so the release workflow does not publish this module to
Maven Central.
