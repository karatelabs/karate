# Karate Mock Servlet Demo

This is a simple Spring Boot 2 application (almost a copy of the "[Producer](https://github.com/intuit/karate/tree/master/examples/consumer-driven-contracts)" in the Consumer Driven Contracts example) that demonstrates use of the [`karate-mock-servlet`](https://github.com/intuit/karate/tree/master/karate-mock-servlet) for running tests - without having to start an app-server.
